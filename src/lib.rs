/// An exercise implementation of Shanks Baby-step giant-step for arbitrary groups. No optimizations were kept in mind for it. The idea is to create a function which would work with any group, so
/// it needs to be provided needed information about the group itself (`operation` and inverse) and the `order` of the element that was exponentiated.

// `usize` is an arbitrary choice, also see https://users.rust-lang.org/t/integer-square-root/96/6
/// Takes 
/// * an `element` of the group which would act as the "base of logarithm",
///   * its `order`, square root of which defines size of the problem;
/// * `value_pow` as the "argument to logarithm";
/// * group's binary `operation`;
/// * and unary `inverse_fn` which returns inverse element in the group.
